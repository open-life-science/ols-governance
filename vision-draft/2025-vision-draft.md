# OLS is seeking feedback on our proposed organisational values

***To be shared for community input.***

This draft of values has been developed using feedback and input from the OLS Team, and Governance Advisory Committee in 2023 and 2024.

## Organisation Framework to Guide Our Areas of Work

## Proposed values

***Openness, Collaboration, Integrity, Learning, Inclusion and Equity, Respect and Kindness***

* **Openness:**
    * **Community-wide: **OLS champions transparency through accessible resources, clear processes, and a commitment to 'as open as possible, as closed as necessary.' We strive to democratise knowledge and empower participation by making our work visible and understandable.
    * **Work process: **We embed a culture of reflection by regularly asking, 'How can we increase the openness of our work?' This proactive approach ensures continuous improvement and aligns our actions with our open principles.
* **Collaboration:**
    * **Community-wide: **OLS cultivates a collaborative ecosystem where knowledge is shared freely, projects are designed for collaboration and diverse perspectives are valued. We believe that community collaboration drives innovation.
    * **Work process: **We build safe spaces and mutual trust within our teams, enabling open communication, constructive feedback, and shared ownership of our work.
* **Integrity:**
    * **Community-wide: **OLS is committed to responsible research practices, scientific integrity, transparent communication, and accountability.
    * **Work process: **We ensure rigour in our research, training, and services through research-based, transparent methodologies, and a commitment to ethical decision-making.
* **Learning:**
    * **Community-wide: **OLS is a dynamic learning community, where continuous growth and knowledge exchange are celebrated. We provide opportunities for skill development, peer learning, and mentorship for individuals to progress their work and communities in open science.
    * **Work process: **We invest in the continuous professional development of our team, providing opportunities for skill enhancement and fostering a culture of lifelong learning.
* **Inclusion & Equity:**
    * **Community-wide: **OLS is dedicated to creating an inclusive and equitable community, where diverse voices are amplified, and people feel welcome and valued, regardless of background, identity, or expertise.
    * **Work process: **We implement inclusive practices in all our team activities, ensuring equitable access to resources, opportunities, and support.
* **Respect & Kindness:**
    * **Community-wide: **OLS fosters a supportive and compassionate community, where we build strong relationships through respect and kindness towards all members.
    * **Work process: **We cultivate a culture of kindness and respect within our team, ensuring that all members feel valued and supported.

**Other considerations:**



* **Global Perspective:**
    * Given OLS's international reach, values will be reviewed by community members to ensure they can be interpreted as intended by different community members in a culturally sensitive manner.
    * A timeline has been developed: 
* **Operationalisation:**
    * After community review, OLS will develop strategies for implementing each value. 
* **Continual evaluation:**
    * As recommended by our Governance Committee, values and their operationalisation are subjective, and change with time. OLS will therefore create a space for continual evaluation of its values, and how they are being put into practice.
