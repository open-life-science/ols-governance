# Open Life Science (OLS) Governance Overview

OLS (formerly Open Life Science) is a non-profit organisation for open science training and capacity building. OLS community has engaged 400+ open science learners and practitioners from across the globe through its Open Seeds training and mentoring programme. OLS is committed to improving the participation of marginalised and underrepresented communities in open science and research more broadly. The OLS Core team includes an Executive Director; three Co-Directors; two full-time employees, and two Resident Fellows, working across different projects in varying capacities (read details in [OLS Team and Organisation](docs/ols-team-organisation.md))

For any questions, concerns or additional details, please email [team@we-are-ols.org](mailto:team@we-are-ols.org), or directly contact the Directors ([directors@we-are-ols.org](mailto:directors@we-are-ols.org)).

As a community-based project, OLS draws mentors, facilitators and experts from the OLS community to support the mentees onboarded for each round of the training and mentoring programme (Open Seeds). We provide honoraria, microgrants and seed funding available to all participants to support and incentivise their contributions to Open Science.

## Framework for Community Involvement (2023-2025)

### **Phase 1: Inviting Leaders for Developing Ways of Working - 2023**

1. **Selection and invitation:**
    * Invite individuals who have taken active leadership, collaborative or advisory roles in OLS. Names suggested and agreed by the Committee and/or executive leadership, considering diverse representations and areas of work. 
2. **Collaborative Definition of Scope:**
    * Hold meetings and collaborative processes involving the Committee members and the Executive leadership to define the scope and ways of working for the Committee.
    * Encourage open dialogue and diverse perspectives and finalise how the Committee will have an overview of OLS work.
    * Publish the reviewed documents for public access and invite comments from the OLS community.

### **Phase 2: Governance Committee's Role in Improving Transparency - 2024**

1. **Feedback and Recommendations:**
    * Establish a regular feedback loop between the Governance Committee and the OLS leadership.
    * Encourage proactive suggestions for improving transparency in OLS leadership and operations.
    * Build transparency by sharing summaries from the meetings for the broader community.
2. **Sustainability Focus:**
    * Involve the committee in exploring funding, strategy, and leadership opportunities in OLS.
    * Encourage collaboration with local communities for skills development and capacity building in the scope of OLS.
    * Design an open and accessible nomination process for community members with recommendations from the committee. 

### **Phase 3: Community Nominations for 2025 Onwards**

1. **Nomination Process:**
    * Ensure a transparent and fair process for selecting individuals.
    * Consider criteria such as active participation, leadership, and commitment to OLS values.
2. **Continuation of Leadership:**
    * Ensure a smooth transition (rotating some members in, others out) for part of the Committee from 2024, and fill seats with members who wish to start their roles in 2025 for the next 1 - 2 years.
    * Foster a sense of continuity in governance and decision-making.

## **Overall Considerations:**

These principles aim to promote transparency, inclusivity, and continuous improvement within the governance committee, ensuring that it effectively serves the OLS community's needs and values.

**Transparency and Communication:**

* Regularly communicate updates and progress with the Committee and seek open and timely feedback and recommendations.
* Encourage open communication via Slack channels, emails, documentation and meetings for feedback and suggestions.

**Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion:**

* Strive for diversity within the Committee to ensure a broad range of perspectives, abilities/disabilities, geographical locations, expertise, and backgrounds.
* Establish processes that are accessible and equitable for all current members of the Committee and future members from the OLS community.

**Capacity Building:**

* Support Committee activities that enhance their skills and visibility, as well as benefit the broader OLS community.
* Encourage Committee members to integrate local capacity-building activities with OLS when appropriate and beneficial for the broader communities.

**Feedback Mechanisms:**

* Establish mechanisms for collecting feedback from the community on governance practices applied in the Committee’s work.
* Utilise feedback to continually refine and improve OLS’ governance structure and transparency for how decisions are made and communicated to the community.

**Documentation and Evaluation:**

* Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of the governance structure and make adjustments as needed. Document decisions, processes, and lessons learned from the Committee’s work for future reference.
* Foster transparency by sharing information from the Committee with the broader community and vice versa.

### Term of office, Legal status and OLS Team support

**Term Length:**

* 1-2 Years. Upon completion of 1 year, members will have an opportunity to renew their membership for up to 12 months. Maximum term length is 2 years.
* Members can step down at any time - following the offboarding process.
* Upon completion of 2-year terms, existing members can be nominated/self-nominated for election for one more term. Service after two full terms (4 years maximum) won’t be possible.
* We encouraged staggered terms (some members opting to stay on the Committee) to avoid the entire committee rotating off simultaneously and losing the institutional memory.

**Time Commitment:**

* Suggested time commitment: 1.5 hours for meetings per month.
* Time commitment before and after the meeting may vary based on tasks undertaken or actions agreed by the members of the Governance Committee.

**Legal Status:**

* Roles are **voluntary**, and honoraria can be provided within the budget allocated by the Executive Director in agreement with our finance officer.
* An accessibility fund will be made available to ensure that Committee members can participate in carrying out their responsibilities.
* Governance advisory committee members are not legally responsible for OLS; the directors are listed on [Companies House](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/12824090).

**OLS Team Support for the Committee:**

* Support will provided by the organisation Liaison (1-2 executive leadership members) and Secretariat in managing logistics, facilitating knowledge exchange and directing timely feedback to and from the OLS team.
* The level of involvement from the OLS Team will be determined by the Governance Committee based on the desired level of support.
