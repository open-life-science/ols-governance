# Open Life Science (OLS) Governance Overview

# OLS organisation structure and community roles document

OLS (formerly Open Life Science) is a non-profit organisation for open science training and capacity building. OLS community has engaged 400+ open science learners and practitioners from across the globe through its Open Seeds training and mentoring programme. OLS is committed to improve participation of marginalised and underrepresented communities in open science and research more broadly. The OLS Core team includes an Executive Director; three Co-Directors; two full time employees, and two Resident Fellows, working across different projects in varying capacities (see

As a community-based project, OLS draws mentors, facilitators and experts from the OLS community to support the mentees onboarded for each round of training and mentoring programme (Open Seeds). We provide honoraria, microgrant and seed funding available to all participants to support and incentivise their contributions to Open Science.

## OLS Governance Committee: Inaugural 2023

In 2023, we are formalising the OLS governance by drawing community leaders from the alumni network to form a Governance Committee. The composition of the Governance Committee includes individuals and representatives from the community and partnering organisations, ensuring representation of diverse technical expertise, individual experience and geographical perspectives.

## Operating principles

The governance of OLS is designed around six principles **that centres diversity/intersectionality, equity, inclusion, collaboration and accessibility**:

1. Recognise and reward all, speicifically volunteer and hidden, labour in open science
2. Ensure operational continuity of OLS core services
3. Integrate contextual approaches in all engagements
4. Establish evidence-based practices through research and impact study
5. Build collaboration across open science projects and community members
6. Embed long-term sustainability processes and values in all our work
