## Types of Meetings, Duration and Mode

The Committee will convene in regular meetings and has the option of scheduling extraordinary meetings.

* **Regular Meetings**: Monthly meetings will be scheduled, with the timing of each future meeting agreed upon after a Committee meeting through consensus.
* **Duration**: 90 minutes, except stated differently
* **Quorum**: Committee meetings shall require the presence of a minimum of 50% of Committee members and the Committee Chair to vote on any decision. Additionally, the Board Liaison or another Board member must be present and will vote only in tiebreaker situations.
* **Mode**: Committee meetings will be virtual and synchronous, with asynchronous work to complete any activities that could not be undertaken synchronously. Meetings will be recorded, and minutes will be available in a sharable format. Preparation for a meeting includes reviewing the minutes of the previous meeting and sharing the agenda for the next meeting.
* **Extraordinary (Emergency) Meetings**: An extraordinary meeting will be called when requested by the Board or upon the request of two Committee members. Summons will be made through available communication channels at least five days in advance, considering the time availability of the majority of Committee members.

### Meeting Agenda, Minutes and Transparency

**Meeting Agenda.** Each meeting will have access to the agenda with the topics to be addressed with the Committee. The first version of this agenda will be shared through an exclusive channel for the Committee at least one week before each meeting and may be updated until the previous day. Agenda points may be submitted via the Slack channel or proposed by the Chair of the meeting. Each member of the Committee and OLS Team will be able to add topics or issues that they consider appropriate to be addressed collectively. 

**Meeting Minutes**: The minutes of each Committee meeting will capture key deliberations, show options for action, and make recommendations for Board members to endorse or decide upon. The minutes should be included in the next meeting and reflect the needs of the Committee.

Committee meeting agendas will be accessible to all members of the OLS Executive Leadership Team (as described in the team handbook) to consult and add items to, with prior notice to the Board. OLS Team members will have access to meeting minutes but will not participate in or vote during Committee meetings. OLS Team members involved in governance work will have full access to relevant documents and meeting minutes.

Between regular meetings, the Board may share an asynchronous informal update to keep the Committee up to date, and Committee members involved in different areas of work will report on the status of the work. Additionally, six-monthly formal reports will be prepared by the Board and submitted to the Committee, shared with the OLS community Slack channels, and accessible to the entire internal team and active community members. An annual report will be prepared with inputs from the board, and when meeting minutes and memos are shared openly, sensitive data privacy and protection must be considered.
