# OLS Governance: Definitions and abbreviations

## Roles

**OLS key members:** A key member can refer to a member of volunteer leadership roles such as a member of the Governance Committee and other key non-employee groups that are formally established with the approval of the leadership. In OLS, we have tried to be as explicit as possible when defining roles and responsibilities. In some cases, OLS key members can elect a representative or chairperson to represent their interests in official meetings related to the organisation.

**Board of Directors (Board):** The people collectively responsible for governing and leadership of our organisation through strategic policy direction and financial oversight. They carry out their role in conjunction with an advisory committee and other key members of their organisation. 

**OLS Staff/Employee:** All paid members (full or part-time positions) as Directors, programme/project managers and researchers are considered OLS staff. As of April 2025, this includes the Executive Director, Co-Directors, Programme Manager, Community Coordinator and Researchers. Resident Fellows and/or the Board who are not paid (as employees or via contracts) are not considered staff.

**Governance Advisory Committee (Committee):** The OLS Governance Committee is a dedicated group of individuals appointed to provide strategic oversight and guidance in shaping the governance framework of OLS. This committee provides advisory support in decision-making, transparency, and sustainability within OLS.  Current committee members are listed on the website: [https://we-are-ols.org/governance.html](https://we-are-ols.org/governance.html). 

**Resident Fellows:** OLS hosts Resident Fellows, drawing from previous graduates, mentors and/or collaborators in ongoing projects. Fellows are recruited on a rolling basis based on their areas of interest in open science that align with OLS’ vision for open science capacity building. These are paid positions and their scope and tasks are allocated by the OLS Team. Based on the available funding, OLS can host a limited number of fellows at a time. This pathway is also open through collaborative grant proposals for funding from resources outside of OLS. Resident Fellows work as a part of the OLS team, participating in OLS activities and carrying out responsibilities that allow them to build their professional and leadership experience, providing a stronger foundation for future leadership roles. 

**OLS Team (Team):** In this document, we use “Team” to collectively refer to the OLS paid staff including OLS’s executive team and board of directors, Resident Fellows who are involved in the day-to-day activities of OLS.

**OLS-SSI Fellows:** OLS has collaborated with the Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) to host a limited number of OLS Alumni as OLS-SSI fellows in SSI Fellow networks. This allows SSI to offer fellowship to a larger pool of international fellows who qualify through the rigorous selection process of SSI fellowship. They are not part of the  Team.

**FSC - fiscally sponsored community:** Initiatives with an interest in open research or other OLS-adjacent domains that OLS fiscally sponsors. OLS provides the administrative and financial infrastructure, allowing FSCs to focus on their specific community-driven initiatives without the initial burden of managing their own non-profit status.


## Terminology

**Advocacy:** Any action that speaks in favour of, recommends, argues for a cause, supports, defends or pleads on behalf of others.

**By-laws:** A policy document that sets up the internal structure and rules of the organisation. They provide the framework for internal governance and day-to-day operations.

**Capacity building:** ​​The process of developing and strengthening the skills, instincts, abilities, processes and resources that organisations and communities need to survive, adapt and thrive.

**Chair:** A person appointed to manage the business of the advisory or key groups/committee and with the executive authority provided under an organisation’s constitution and by-laws.

**Committee:** A primary way in which members contribute to the work and views of the organisation. Common standing committees may be established based on the needs in the organisation such as to audit, build policy, manage finance, help provide membership support and represent regional views. Ad hoc committees are commonly formed to deal with specific issues that arise or become a concern.

**Compliance:** Oversee processes to comply with legal and regulatory requirements.

**Conflicts of interest:** A conflict of interest is a situation in which a key member (or one of their immediate family) has a private or personal interest, directly or indirectly, that (potentially) influences or appears to influence the objective exercise of their duties as a key member, to the detriment or benefit of the organisation.

**Contextualisation** of knowledge: This refers to the efforts to teach critical thinking skills in which we learn to reflect on the social, cultural, and disciplinary context in which knowledge is created (reference from [Impact at the Core](https://www.eur.nl/en/impactatthecore/inclusive-education/contextualization-knowledge)). In open science, contextualisation leads to important questions about the nature of science and knowledge: Whose science is being open? By whom? Who is going to benefit from these new framings and practices? What are the risks? Will this lead to equality and equity of knowledge access and production by researchers in unequal settings? Will Open Science disrupt the existing global power structure of knowledge legitimation? Will it lead to further marginalisation of knowledge from the Global South? How will Open Science contribute toward the Sustainable Development Goals? (reference: [Contextualising openness](https://idrc-crdi.ca/sites/default/files/openebooks/Contextualizing-Openness/9781552506110.html))

**Decolonisation of knowledge:** An act of *undoing* our way of thinking about knowledge and reconstructing it by learning new and in new ways rather than those imposed on people, institutions, or nations through the process of colonisation ([Mitova, 2020](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/05568641.2020.1779606);[ Wiredu, 2002](https://philpapers.org/rec/WIRCDA-2)). “*Epistemic decolonisation is an act of liberation*” (Mungwini 2019a: 71). This is in part because of this direction-toward, or openness to, a future that includes the (formerly) colonised. The significance of the relational aspiration expressed in this position should never be lost. Epistemic liberation depends in part on our ability to reclaim the universal "right to reason" in terms of being able to theorise our reality as a people, including refusal to remain fixated with the northbound gaze in the form of blind submission to a hegemonic and parochial universalism.* (Mungwini, P., Creller, A., Monahan, M. J., & Murdock, E. G. (2019). [Why Epistemic Decolonization? JWP, 4(2), 70–105](https://scholarworks.iu.edu/iupjournals/index.php/jwp/article/view/3116)).*

**Direct member**: An individual who has participated in OLS as a mentor, expert, facilitator, or mentee.

**Governance:** The framework of rules, relationships, systems and processes within and by which authority/decision-making is exercised and regulated in organisations.

**Management:** An organisation’s leadership team, including the executive team and the board of directors.

**Minutes:** Documents that record the activities and decisions of a meeting.

**Mission statement:** A statement that expresses what an organisation does to achieve its purpose.

**Not-for-profit:** A not-for-profit organisation does not operate for the profit or gain of its members.

**Off-boarding:** Offboarding is the formal process of separation between a key member and OLS, typically due to resignation, termination, or retirement. This process also applies when an existing organisational member steps down from a specific role (within a project) without affecting their broader involvement in other roles or projects within OLS.

**Onboarding:** Onboarding is the process by which new individuals transition from being external to OLS to becoming integrated members. This process can also facilitate the movement of existing OLS members into new roles within the organisation.

**Organisational member**: Organisations that have a partnership, membership, or other contractual agreements with OLS. 

**Protocol:** A system of rules that explains the correct conduct and procedures to be followed in formal situations.

**Quorum:** The number of key members or directors who must be present for a meeting to be valid.

**Strategic plan:** How an organisation defines its purpose and goals, beyond the immediate future, and the actions to address challenges to achieve those goals. 

**Transparency:** Organisations are transparent when they enable others to see and understand how they operate honestly. To achieve transparency, an organisation must provide information that is accurate and complete, and on time, about its activities and governance to stakeholders. 

**Vision statement:** A statement that expresses the current and future objectives of an organisation and is intended as a guide to help the organisation make decisions that align with its philosophy and declared set of goals.
