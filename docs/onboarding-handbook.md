## Foreword

Welcome to the OLS!		

Participation in the OLS organisation is effective and meaningful only when our participants are provided equitable and supportive opportunities to add value to the OLS’ work through representation, advocacy and diverse perspectives they bring from their communities. Strong, independent and representative members are essential for reaching our capacity building goals by applying open science skills, promoting open practices and creating a collaborative environment in which all members of our global community, and the local communities they represent, can thrive. *(Adapted from Deborah France-Massin, Director of the Bureau for Employers’ Activities, International Labour Organization)*.

To support the mission of OLS, the Board of Directors will approve and maintain the onboarding handbook for the new members of OLS Governance Committee and other key groups. The intent is to educate and continually guide its members to a high level of strategic success and achievement in accordance with best practices.

The handbook contains information and linked documents regarding relevant processes, policies, organisational structure and roles of the Governance Committee. **It serves as a resource for the members of Governance Committee and other formally constituted non-employee groups in  OLS – referred to as “OLS key members” in this document** –  in determining the manner in which business matters are to be conducted.

New members should be clear about what serving as a key member in OLS will involve. It is critical to good governance that OLS members understand existing policies and Code of Conduct, take steps to address conflicts of interest and apply the highest levels of integrity and ethics to ensure that matters before the OLS key members are looked at from multiple perspectives.

New members should be clear on how their role differs from those of managers and employees. As a key reference source, this handbook should be revisited over time to support your role as a new OLS key member on an equal footing with those who have been involved for a longer period.

Please email [directors@we-are-ols.org](mailto:directors@we-are-ols.org) to ask any questions and give us any feedback on our ways of working as OLS key members. 

## How to use this handbook				

First, read the [definitions and abbreviation document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MipWr6-qY8uOGVrEldZy2IZ1Vjm9bS1PZOzIorrXFoE/edit#heading=h.o9cqpadm318m). 
These are critical for making sense of the terms commonly used in governance and organisational management.

Second, take notes on the points that will help get you “up to speed” in your role as an OLS key member, referring back regularly to the handbook as you familiarise yourself with your new role.

Third, **review the guidance for onboarding from part 1 continuing to part 4** with checklists, ensuring that **you have access to information** and documents that have been provided for the work of the Governance Committee.

In the **part-1,** you will learn about different resources OLS has that offer information about the organisation. In the **part-2,** we give governance-related information shared across different documents – please take the time you need to review them to facilitate your participation.

In the **part-3** of your onboarding, we ask you to please send details required to confirm your participation via the [Declaration of Participation form](https://forms.gle/VWJfNoc5HUkQBNs89). Please also send details required to record your current engagements across different projects via the [Declaration of Conflict of Interest form](https://forms.gle/r2bhsPFvzdeq3VXH8). Check your access to different resources available to you in **part-4**.

Finally, review out offboarding handbook, provided in a separate document.

When reviewing, we encourage you to be objective and constructive about how we design and establish the processes that can be followed in the future by the Governance Committee.
If you are unsure, ask questions to your fellow OLS members. Remember, this is teamwork, and your fellow OLS members are happy to help you to get up to speed quickly to ensure that you have the opportunity to exchange skills, knowledge and experience with each other, and contribute to the sustainability of the organisation.	

This handbook is a tool to facilitate an improved understanding of good governance, responsibilities and ways of working.	
We hope that this document will help with your engagement as an OLS key member, providing present practices, information and resources to assist with the implementation of good practices in our organisation. 

The contents of this handbook are based on legislative requirements and relevant better practices at the time of the preparation.

## Governance resources

OLS is a non-profit organisation for open science training and capacity building. OLS community has engaged 400+ open science learners and practitioners from across the globe through its Open Seeds training and mentoring programme. OLS is committed to improve participation of marginalised and underrepresented communities in open science and research more broadly. The OLS Core team includes an Executive Director; three Co-Directors; two full time employees, and two Resident Fellows, working across different projects in varying capacities (see 

[their specific roles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUHvYv5wvZiJSK4yYDwwDHs9Ds6tCjqB3XezqCaetEI/edit#heading=h.z4btaswsbn2d)). For any question, concern or additional details, please email [team@we-are-ols.org](mailto:team@we-are-ols.org), or directly contact the Directors ([directors@we-are-ols.org](mailto:directors@we-are-ols.org)).   

In the process of formalising the OLS governance, we are drawing community leaders from the alumni network to form a Governance Committee. The composition of the Governance Committee will include individuals and representatives from the community and partnering organisations, ensuring representation of diverse technical expertise, individual experience and geographical perspectives.

***Their onboarding begins after they have agreed to serve as a new OLS key member upon invitation by a core team member or a formal election process - and should be completed before the kick-off meeting.***

## Part 2: Reading the internal governance overview document

***Mandatory Reading***

All new Governance Committee members are required to read and acknowledge information shared in this part. As the inaugural cohort, you will be required to read the following information, which will be discussed in a committee meeting to ensure you have the chance to help improve them through alignment with your and OLS’ value:

- [ ] [Vision and Mission](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AxQJdjHV3XjYZaJByd2TUAvdYHtYVuk6WJW5sbUwuec/edit#heading=h.cff12b3t00oi)
- [ ]  [Guiding principles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ezf65nUXmUKS2FHVG3-RJVBzNgbT3-9rwvbQIx0rdv4/edit#heading=h.n5d5pxthwbin)

***Governance Documentation***

To understand the OLS organisational structure, Governance Committee's role and how they interface, we have created various resources detailing the Governance Procedure.

In 2023, the first Governance Committee reviewed these governance documents to help improve and inform the processes. These documents will aid their work in the committee going forward. 
The responsibilities for review was spread out, so that not all members reviewed all the documents. 
However, they reviewed at least two (beside the mandatory document) documents to lead the discussion during a full committee meeting. 
All committee members were asked to raise any concern, propose solutions for improvement.
At the end of review stage, they integrated changes and approved the document as part of the governance resources. 

***Documents to develop***

The committee will help define the obligations and responsibilities as they emerge, ensuring each individual participating in this Committee understand their role, and propose initiatives they’d like to lead or inform, and act on OLS’ priority areas in the current and the future iterations of the committee.

## Part 3: Updating the internal governance document and website

To update your info in the internal governance document, please share:

- [ ] your title (optional), first and last name, preferred pronouns (optional) 
- [ ] Contact detail (email, postal address - optional) 
- [ ] telephone number (optional)
- [ ] Emergency contact details (name, first and last name, relationship)

For the website, please share:

- [ ] a short bio
- [ ] a current profile image (optional by emailing [team@we-are-ols.org](mailto:team@we-are-ols.org)) 

Send all of these via the **[Declaration of Participation](https://forms.gle/X9sC2VZ4GNzKdcPA7)** (Google Form). 

### Declaration of Conflict of Interest

After they have agreed to join the OLS governance or other key groups, invited/elected members must identify and sign the **[Declaration of Conflict of Interest](https://forms.gle/r2bhsPFvzdeq3VXH8)** (Google Form). 

A conflict of interest is a situation in which a key member (or one of their relatives) has a private or personal interest, directly or indirectly, that (potentially) influences or appears to influence the objective exercise of their duties as a key member, to the detriment or benefit of the organisation. An actual conflict is when a key member faces a real and existing conflict of interest; a potential conflict is a conflict of interest that does not exist yet but may occur; and perceived conflict is when a key member appears to have a conflict of interest, even if this is not the case. A conflict of interest here doesn't necessarily have negative connotation, and should not be confused with 'conflicting interest' (later meaning two or more interests that are incompatible or cannot be reconciled). This declaration will improve our awareness as you participate in the committee and bring alignments. Serving as a Governance Committee member should not end up harming your role in other places and vice versa, and in some cases can be used for benefitting shared positive goals for all parties involved.
