# Governance Committee Chair Responsibilities

## Governance Committee Chair Responsibilities

The Governance Committee meets every month. Members of the governance committee may assume the chair role on a rotating basis to share the leadership responsibility while avoiding putting the responsibility on one person. The chair will liaise with the Organisation Liaison to organise the upcoming Committee meeting and take responsibility for its operations as listed below. The organisation liaison and secretary will support them in the operations and logistics.

## Additional functions and responsibilities of the Governance Committee Chair

- During the meeting for a specific month, the new chair for the next month will be identified or selected by self-nomination/voting/etc. (If more than one meeting is scheduled for the next month, then an appropriate number of chairs will be required (timezone-wise)).
- In month n+1, the new chair(s) will circulate the meeting document to invite the agenda from the board and the committee members.
