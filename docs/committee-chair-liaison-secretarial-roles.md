# Committee Chair, Liaison and Secretarial Roles

## Governance Committee Chair Responsibilities

These are additional functions and responsibilities of the Governance Committee Chair:

The Governance Committee meets every month. Members of the governance committee will assume the chair role on a rotating basis (starting from 2024) to share the leadership responsibility while avoiding putting the responsibility on one person. The chair will liaise with the Organisation Liaison to organise the upcoming Committee meeting and take responsibility for its operations as listed below. The organisation liaison and secretary will support them in the operations and logistics.

### Before the Meeting

- During the meeting for a specific month, the new chair for the next month will be identified or selected by self-nomination/voting/etc. (If more than one meeting is scheduled for the next month, then an appropriate number of chairs will be required (timezone-wise)).
- In month n+1, the new chair(s) will circulate the meeting document to invite the agenda from the board and the committee members.
- They will provide agenda points along with the Board, identify and assign agenda items to specific people from the committee and the organisation's liaison or secretary to lead if a dedicated person for a specific agenda has not already been identified.

### During the Meeting

- Chair the meetings and approve the meeting minutes for circulation among the Committee members and OLS Team members.
- Enforce the Code of Conduct in the meeting and lead discussions inclusively, fairly allowing agenda points to be discussed and concluded with actions for moving forward.
- Facilitate voting and communicate the consensus reached.
- Facilitate selection/election of the next chair.

### After the Meeting

- Liaise with the secretary to share the summary of the meeting with the committee and board, sharing actions, the person/group the action has been assigned to, and the timeline.
- Maintain meeting notes and clarify any errors/unclear statements.
- Before the next meeting, follow up on the actions and share any update that the next chair needs to know for the next meeting.
- Share action points and recommendations with the OLS Board in a written format in the meeting minutes, which will be passed on by the organisation Liaison and Secretariat.

**Specific Committee Members will be invited to**:

- Represent the Committee in OLS Team-related engagements as needed.
- Facilitate any conflict and enforcement of the Code of Conduct in the Committee outside the meeting.
- Help resolve conflictive or emerging issues by advising the Committee and the Board members.

## Organisation Liaison and Secretariat

1-2 members from the Board of Directors will be appointed as an Organisation Liaison, and a non-director member will be appointed as an Organisation Secretary. Together they are responsible for the governance work.

They create a direct line of contact between the Committee and the OLS Board and keep the rest of the OLS team informed. They support the logistical and operational needs of the Committee, including the following:

They manage governance documentation, allocate resources such as staff time or funding as available, manage communication channels, and follow up with the Committee members on relevant matters during and outside the Committee meetings.
