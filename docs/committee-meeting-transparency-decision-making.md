## Types of Meetings, Duration and Mode

The Committee will convene in regular meetings and has the option of scheduling extraordinary meetings.

* **Regular Meetings**: Monthly meetings will be scheduled, with the timing of each future meeting agreed upon after a Committee meeting through consensus.
* **Duration**: 90 minutes, except stated differently
* **Quorum**: Committee meetings shall require the presence of a minimum of 50% of Committee members and the Committee Chair to vote on any decision. Additionally, the Board Liaison or another Board member must be present and will vote only in tiebreaker situations.
* **Mode**: Committee meetings will be virtual and synchronous, with asynchronous work to complete any activities that could not be undertaken synchronously. Meetings will be recorded, and minutes will be available in a sharable format. Preparation for a meeting includes reviewing the minutes of the previous meeting and sharing the agenda for the next meeting.
* **Extraordinary (Emergency) Meetings**: An extraordinary meeting will be called when requested by the Board or upon the request of two Committee members. Summons will be made through available communication channels at least five days in advance, considering the time availability of the majority of Committee members.

### Meeting Agenda, Minutes and Transparency

**Meeting Agenda.** Each meeting will have access to the agenda with the topics to be addressed with the Committee. The first version of this agenda will be shared through an exclusive channel for the Committee at least one week before each meeting and may be updated until the previous day. Agenda points may be submitted via the Slack channel or proposed by the Chair of the meeting. Each member of the Committee and OLS Team will be able to add topics or issues that they consider appropriate to be addressed collectively. 

**Meeting Minutes**: The minutes of each Committee meeting will capture key deliberations, show options for action, and make recommendations for Board members to endorse or decide upon. The minutes should be included in the next meeting and reflect the needs of the Committee.

Committee meeting agendas will be accessible to all members of the OLS Core team to consult and add items to, with prior notice to the Board. OLS Team members will have access to meeting minutes but will not participate in or vote during Committee meetings. Each group working on different priority areas should have a representative from the OLS Core Team outside committee meetings. OLS Core Team members involved in priority areas will have full access to relevant documents and meeting minutes.

Between regular meetings, the Board may share an asynchronous informal update to keep the Committee up to date, and Committee members involved in different areas of work will report on the status of the work. Additionally, six-monthly formal reports will be prepared by the Board and submitted to the Committee, shared with the OLS community Slack channels, and accessible to the entire internal team and active community members. An annual report will be prepared with inputs from the board, and when meeting minutes and memos are shared openly, sensitive data privacy and protection must be considered.

## Committee's Decision Making

**Voting and Consensus Building** To encourage the voice and input of those who actively participate in the Committee, two modes of decision-making through consensus building and voting will be enabled, one synchronous and the other asynchronous. Anonymity may not be possible for either modality, but only the outcomes will be openly shared with the community. 

**Informed voting.** To encourage informed voting, the Committee is committed to addressing the items by listening to all voices, and considering both arguments for and against, in both voting modalities.

**Types of voting.** In the case of each proposal subject to debate, each active member may make a statement, indicating name and surname (roll call vote) and according to the times set for each modality: whether they "Agrees", "Disagrees" or "Abstain" from the initiative presented. In case of abstention, they must justify the reasons to help us improve the decision-making process.

### Protocols

1. **Synchronous mode.** After the discussion and exchange of different points of view, the topic is voted on. The Chair repeats and clarifies orally what is to be voted on, to encourage informed voting and allow everyone to know what is being voted on. 

**Recording and counting of votes.** Then, the vote is recorded in a collaborative document specially enabled to do so in an open and reusable format, in which each person will have individual access to write their vote.

In case any person is unable for any reason to use that channel, the Chair will ask them to make a statement in some way and will facilitate their registration. 

2. **Asynchronous mode.** Voting is done in the same collaborative document. Voting is explicitly announced via the Slack channel of OLS:
* initiatives subject to voting
* options for each initiative
* deadline date and time for voting
* link to the collaborative document to register their vote.

### Voting Process and Outcomes
  
Voting will be open for 5 business days from the notification on the Slack channel for the Committee.

Decisions must be approved by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of those members who actively participate in the Committee.
It is critically important to recognise that the Committee can make recommendations through their decision-making process to the OLS Board, which retains responsibility for final action that affects the organisation's activities. 

**Tied votes.** In the event of tied alternatives, the Board Liaison’s vote shall determine the decision. If this person abstains, at least one Board member shall have the duty to resolve the issue with their vote between the tied alternatives.

**Red flags.** As a remedy in exceptional situations, the Chair or active Committee members can activate this mechanism when they consider that the issues addressed or submitted to vote do not or may not comply with OLS’s values. To do so, they can email the full Committee via Slack or Email within 5 working days and the issue must be discussed again asynchronously or in an extraordinary meeting. 

**Recording and publicity of voting.** The outcome of voting in both synchronous and asynchronous meetings will be open to the OLS Team and will be documented in an internal and collaborative record to integrate the recommendations into their work with the guidance and support from the Board.
