## Platforms and Process for Coordination

The OLS Executive Leadership Team will establish a GitHub repository where all governance resources for public access will be shared openly. GitHub's Issue and Pull Request features will be used for voting, asynchronous discussions, community review, and transparency.

Resources intended for internal access by the Committee will be shared via Google Drive and a private GitHub repository, as agreed with the Committee.

A project board and GitHub issues will be used for managing, assigning, and tracking the progress of governance-related tasks and responsibilities.
