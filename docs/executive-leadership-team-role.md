# OLS Executive Leadership Team's Responsibilities

Members of the Board of Directors (especially in paid roles) and other executive leaders (as defined in the OLS's team handbook) will support the functioning of the Governance Advisory Committee (Committee). A non-board member will be appointed as Organisation Secretary to support governance responsibilities.

Together with the Committee, they are responsible for OLS's governance, community involvement, and decision-making.

## Platforms and Process for Coordination

The OLS Executive Leadership Team will establish a GitHub repository where all governance resources for public access will be shared openly. GitHub's Issue and Pull Request features will be used for voting, asynchronous discussions, community review, and transparency.

Resources intended for internal access by the Committee will be shared via Google Drive and a private GitHub repository, as agreed with the Committee.

A project board and GitHub issues will be used for managing, assigning, and tracking the progress of governance-related tasks and responsibilities.
