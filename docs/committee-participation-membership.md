## Active participation

A person is considered to be actively participating in the Committee  if they were present in at least 75% of the annual meetings hosted in their time zones. It is intended and expected that each member of the Committee will notify the Chair and the Board Liaison, via Slack or other communication channels set by the OLS team if circumstances do not allow them to meet the minimum required dedication to vote and/or carry out the tasks at any time during the year. The Committee Chair and Board Liaison will keep a record open to the rest of the Committee of absent and/or inactive persons.

* **Time commitment:** The minimum requirement is 1.5 hours per month for OLS meetings, plus additional time before or after to complete preparatory work or address delegated actions from the meeting. The suggested time commitment for each member in this role can thus be estimated at 2-4 hours per month. This may vary throughout the year based on the tasks undertaken by the Governance Committee.
* **Term length:** Ideally, term lengths of 1-2 years; see details below.
* **Legal status:** The committee members serve on a volunteer basis and will be given honoraria under an allocated budget.

## OLS Team Support

* **OLS Board Liaison and Secretary:** The Governance Committee will have 1-2 OLS Board representatives to support the operational and decision-making process (transparency, policy, communications), provide admin support (such as organising meetings and maintaining documentation), ensure information flow as well as timely feedback between the OLS team and the Committee. A non-director member of the OLS team will be designated as an organisation secretary. They provide operational support to Liaison in ensuring their work with the committee is timely conducted.
    * They will not participate in the voting and consensus-building process of the Committee.
    * The level of involvement of the OLS Liaisons can be requested by the committee as needed to support their work. 
* **OLS roles to support governance work in paid capacity:** Additional paid roles can be created to act on the Committee's recommendations,  especially if the OLS Board and core team is unable to fulfil them within the scope of their roles. These roles will depend on the urgency as identified by the Committee and Board collectively and subjected to funding availability. These roles could provide additional support in designing governance activities, documenting governance resources, acting on specific recommendations made by the committee, leading advocacy work or participating in the organisational work required to advance the governance work in OLS such as providing admin support, ensuring knowledge exchange and timely feedback to the OLS Leadership team.

## Absence/inactivity or not fulfilling the Committee’s responsibilities

Absence or inactivity is defined as missing more than one of the scheduled meetings. Not fulfilling the Committee’s responsibilities means not participating actively (synchronously or asynchronously) in the Committee’s work, which includes process review, Committee meetings, voting and decision-making work undertaken by the Committee. 

Exceptions to these definitions are always welcome to ensure inclusivity and accessibility for all our members.
A reasonable extension of review work to accommodate access requirements, personal schedules, reasonable absences or unforeseeable circumstances can be requested. The Board and Committee should be informed for awareness and record keeping. 

In case of prolonged inactivity, inability or resignation of any member of the Committee, the position shall be considered vacant and an extraordinary meeting shall be called to propose new profiles to complete the office term.

## Continuation of membership

It is assumed that each member has agreed to serve for a minimum of 1 year or a full term of 2 years.
They will be asked to confirm their continuation, if not already communicated and declare their Conflict of Interest on an ongoing basis (every 6 months).

Three months before the ending (end of a 2-year term), members will be asked to indicate their wish to nominate/stand for re-election or step down from the Committee at the end of their ongoing membership. Committee members should let the full Committee know before an upcoming meeting.

### Continuation of membership after a first full term

* A committee member can indicate the continuation of their membership until the end of their official term length, which is 2 years.
   * Different board members can step down at different times. This will be encouraged to help avoid the entire board rotating off all at once.
* If committee members are involved in an OLS project as part of their role and require additional months (3-6 months beyond the 2 years) to complete or hand over responsibilities, they can raise the matter in a Committee meeting for a case-by-case discussion.
   *  Short-term extensions of service should not exceed an additional 6 months and must be approved by the Committee. The Committee liaison will record the continuation of membership for additional months, and no further action is required.
* A member can step down from the Committee at any time if they can no longer serve.
  * If stepping down earlier, members will indicate their preference at a Governance Committee meeting. The Committee liaison will record the intent and begin an offboarding process.
* After completing their term length, Committee members can re-enter the open election the second time.
   * An individual can serve for a maximum of two full-term lengths, which is 4 years. A third-time entry into the election should be avoided to ensure a fair opportunity for community members interested in joining the Committee.

### Stepping down as a Committee Member

* Formally each member will be reminded by the OLS liaison when their term is ending. 
* If a member wishes to step down before the end of their term, the offboarding process can begin at the meeting.
* If a member wishes to step down at the end of their current term, the offboarding process will begin no later than 1 month before the end of the term. 

For electing new members, a call for nomination will be announced by the Committee and remain open for at least 1 month. At the end of the period, the Committee will review and approve the membership to fill the available positions. In the event of a tie, the Board Liaison or Executive Director of OLS will break the tie. 

In cases where membership is renewed for the entire Committee, additional positions will be opened for new members using the general election process.
