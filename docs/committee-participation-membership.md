# Committee Participation and Membership

## Active participation

A person is considered to be actively participating in the Committee  if they were present in at least 75% of the annual meetings. It is intended and expected that each member of the Committee will notify the Chair and the Board Liaison, via Slack or other communication channels set by the OLS team if circumstances do not allow them to meet the minimum required dedication (approximately 2-4 hours per month) to vote and/or carry out the tasks at any time during the year. The Committee Chair and Board Liaison will keep a record open to the rest of the Committee of absent and/or inactive persons.

* **Time commitment:** Suggested time for each member in this role is an average of 2-4 hours per month. This may vary throughout the year based on the tasks undertaken by the Governance Committee.
* **Term length:** Ideally, term lengths of 1-2 years; see details below.
* **Legal status:** The committee members serve on a volunteer basis and will be given honoraria under an allocated budget.

## OLS Team Support
* **OLS Board Liaison and Secretary:** The Governance Committee will have 1-2 OLS Board representatives to support the operational and decision-making process (transparency, policy, communications), provide admin support (such as organising meetings and maintaining documentation), ensure information flow as well as timely feedback between the OLS team and the Committee. A non-director member of the OLS team will be designated as an organisation secretary. They provide operational support to Liaison in ensuring their work with the committee is timely conducted.
    * They will not participate in the voting and consensus-building process of the Committee.
    * The level of involvement of the OLS Liaisons can be requested by the committee as needed to support their work. 
* **OLS roles to support governance work in paid capacity:** To ensure that the Committee’s recommendations don’t immediately fall into the current remit of the OLS team, additional paid roles can be created. These roles will depend on the urgency as identified by the Committee and Board collectively and subjected to funding availability. These roles could provide additional support in designing governance activities, documenting governance resources, acting on specific recommendations made by the committee, leading advocacy work or participating in the organisational work required to advance the governance work in OLS such as providing admin support, ensuring knowledge exchange and timely feedback to the OLS Leadership team.

## Absence/inactivity or not fulfilling the Committee’s responsibilities

Absence or inactivity is defined as missing more than one of the scheduled meetings. Not fulfilling the Committee’s responsibilities means not participating actively (synchronously or asynchronously) in the Committee’s work, which includes process review, Committee meetings, voting and decision-making work undertaken by the Committee. 

Exceptions to these definitions are always welcome to ensure inclusivity and accessibility for all our members.
A reasonable extension of review work to accommodate access requirements, personal schedules, reasonable absences or unforeseeable circumstances can be requested. The Board and Committee should be informed for awareness and record keeping. 

In case of prolonged inactivity, inability or resignation of any member of the Committee, the position shall be considered vacant and an extraordinary meeting shall be called to propose new profiles to complete the office term.

## Continuation of membership

It is assumed that each member has agreed to serve for a minimum of 1 year or a full term of 2 years.
They will be required to declare a Conflict of Interest on an ongoing basis (every 6 months).

Three months before the ending (end of a 2-year term), members will be asked to indicate their wish to nominate/stand for re-election or step down from the Committee at the end of their ongoing membership. Committee members should let the full Committee know before an upcoming meeting.

### Continuation of membership after a first full term

* At the end of 1 year of their service, a committee member can decide to continue their membership for another 6-12 months (going up to 2 years).
   * Members will indicate their preference for membership extension at a Governance Committee meeting and get internal approval from the rest of the Committee members.
   * This staggered rotating off will be encouraged to avoid the whole board rotating off all at once. The Committee liaison will record the continuation of membership for additional months. No further action is required. 
* The maximum term length is 2 years, after which a Committee member can re-enter the open election, but will not be automatically extended for one more full term (another 2 years), but third-time entry to the election should be avoided. This will allow a fair opportunity for community members interested in joining the Committee.
* A member can step down at any time from the Committee if they can no longer serve as a member of the Committee.

### Stepping down as a Committee Member

* Formally each member will be reminded by the OLS liaison when their term is ending. 
* If a member wishes to step down before the end of their term, the offboarding process can begin at the meeting.
* If a member wishes to step down at the end of their current term, the offboarding process will begin no later than 1 month before the end of the term. 

For electing new members, a call for nomination will be announced by the Committee and remain open for at least 1 month. At the end of the period, the Committee will review and approve the membership to fill the available positions. In the event of a tie, the Board Liaison or Executive Director of OLS will break the tie. 

In cases where membership is renewed for the entire Committee, additional positions will be opened for new members using the general election process.
