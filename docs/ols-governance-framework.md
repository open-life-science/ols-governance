# OLS’ Governance Framework

The founders and Co-Directors of OLS referred to as the OLS **Board** (or simply Board), provide leadership in OLS. 
An Executive Director of OLS, with appropriate involvement of co-directors and team members taking responsibilities across different areas of OLS' work, is responsible for governing OLS in line with organisational priorities and commitments. 

The Board carries out its function in conjunction with a Governance Committee that provides advisory support.

The **Governance Committee (Committee)** should be composed of OLS community members from diverse backgrounds, identities, and experiences who can participate in an advisory capacity. There will be a minimum of five Committee Members, but the exact number may vary in each revision of the OLS Governance. The inaugural Committee in 2023 consisted of 10 members.

The Committee is supported by the OLS Team, consisting of 1-2 **Organisation Liaisons** designated from the OLS Board and a non-director member as an **Organisation Secretary**, invited from the OLS team member (here OLS team is non-director staff, resident fellows, and other paid staff).

Together, these members build and operationalise OLS's Governance Framework, building transparency and accountability in OLS' work and decision-making processes that affect the community, enabling a fair, equitable, and more representative space.

## Short Description of Roles in OLS

The Board and Committee together form OLS’ governance structure and participate in the decision-making process.

* **OLS Governance Committee (Committee) and other key members:** A key member can refer to a member of volunteer leadership roles such as a member of the Governance Committee and other key non-employee groups that are formally established with the approval of the leadership. In OLS, we have tried to be as explicit as possible when defining roles and responsibilities. In some cases, OLS key members can elect a representative or chairperson to represent their interests in official meetings related to the organisation. OLS key members in our organisation may come from different forms, there is no one model. The guidelines here may not apply as is to members of the volunteer community or employees.
  * The committee provides an Advisory role to the Board of Directors

* **Board of Directors (Board):** The founders and Co-Directors of OLS are collectively responsible for governing and leadership of our organisation. They carry out their role in conjunction with the Governance Committee and other key members of their organisation. 
  * The Board of Directors escalate matters for transparency and accountability to the Committee.

* **Organisation Liaison and Secretary:** The Committee is supported by 1-2 Board Liaisons and 1 Organisation Secretary invited from the OLS team. The Organisation Liaison and Secretary will enable bidirectional sharing of knowledge and information between the Committee and the OLS team.
  * Organisation Liaison and Secretary create transparency between the Committee, Board and rest of the OLS team. They also work with the Committee to represent community interests and build transparency.

* **OLS Staff/Employee:** All paid members (full or part-time positions) as Directors, programme/project managers and researchers are considered OLS staff. Currently, this includes the Executive Director, Co-Directors, Programme Manager, Community Coordinator and Researchers. Resident Fellows and/or board of directors who are not paid (as employees or via contracts) are not considered staff.
  * These are paid staff of OLS.

* **Resident Fellows:** OLS hosts Resident Fellows, drawing from previous graduates, mentors and/or collaborators in ongoing projects. Fellows are recruited on a rolling basis based on their areas of interest in open science that align with OLS’ vision for open science capacity building. These are paid positions and defined in collaboration with the OLS team. Based on the available funding, OLS can host a limited number of fellows at a time. This pathway is also open through collaborative grant proposals for funding from resources outside the OLS. Resident Fellows work as a part of the OLS team, participating in OLS activities and carrying out responsibilities that allow them to build their professional and leadership experience, providing a stronger foundation for future leadership roles. 
  * These are fixed-term paid fellows of OLS who may or may not join OLS core operations based on their interest and nature of funding.

* **Core team:** In this document, we use “core team” to collectively refer to the OLS staff and Resident Fellows who are involved in the day-to-day activities of OLS.

* **OLS-SSI Fellows:** OLS has collaborated with the Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) to host a limited number of OLS Alumni as OLS-SSI fellows in SSI Fellow networks. This allows SSI to offer fellowship to a larger pool of international fellows who qualify through the rigorous selection process of SSI fellowship. They are not part of the Core Team.

### Governance Committee Membership

The inaugural Committee (2023-2024), composed of members invited by the Board from the OLS community, will create a process for electing new members from the broader community from 2024 onwards. The process will maintain the mix of experienced and early career members to allow a fair opportunity for the community to take leadership roles, participate in peer mentoring, and engage in the knowledge exchange process of the committee's work. Whenever possible, the OLS Board will identify opportunities for more community members to work alongside the Committee, such as through the creation of temporary working groups and task forces, as well as paid positions to act on recommendations from the Committee.

Detailed information about expectations and processes for onboarding and offboarding is provided in the governance documentation, which has been approved by the Committee in 2023.

### Code of Conduct

The [OLS Code of Conduct](https://github.com/open-life-science/policies-procedures-and-docs/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) applies to all OLS members including the Board and the Committee. 

## Long Description for the Stakeholders of the Governance Framework

### Board of Directors

The Board of Directors is a governing body made up of a group of individuals who, together, are authorised and ultimately responsible for the management of an organisation. They are delegated with leadership responsibilities required to make sure that the organisation is working towards achieving its goals. 

⚠️ _The Board of Directors or Board are collectively responsible for governance and leadership of OLS organisation through strategic policy direction and financial oversight. They carry out their role in conjunction with an advisory committee and other key members of their organisation._

The board of OLS include the founders and organisers of OLS who became involved in the OLS leadership between 2019-2021. Since 2022, these members have taken on formalised roles in a paid capacity in 2022-2023 to be paid or recompensed for their work on OLS’ delivery and leadership objectives. The Board is responsible for delivering on the overall strategy, operations and leadership objectives with the advisory support from the Governance Committee.  

As of September 2023, there are four directors: 

* **Executive Director.** Responsible for overall business and development while overseeing the execution of (or directly executing as needed) the OLS' goals according to its vision and mission. The current Executive Director is Yo Yehudi, who is working at 0.6 FTE.
* **Director of Finance and Operations:** Responsible for overseeing the finance management and operational workflow including budgeting, payment system and community investments. The current Director of Finance and Operations is Emmy Tsang, who is working at 0.1 FTE.
* **Director Partnership and Strategy:** Responsible for the organisation’s strategic development through formalising partnerships, community governance and research opportunities in collaboration with community stakeholders. The current Director of Partnership and Strategy is Malvika Sharan, who is working at 0.1 FTE.
* **Director of Technology and Learning:** Responsible for the development of the pedagogical and technical aspects of learning/training infrastructure including web development, data management and learning resources. The current Director of Technology and Learning is Bérénice Batut, who is working at 0.2 FTE.

The Board is  ultimately responsible for all the functions that may arise as necessary to fulfil the goals of OLS.

### Governance Committee (Committee)

⚠️ _Governance Committee (Committee) is a key membership in OLS. A key member in OLS refers to a member of volunteer leadership roles such as a member of the Governance Committee and other key non-employee groups that are formally established with the approval of the leadership. In OLS, we have tried to be as explicit as possible when defining roles and responsibilities. In some cases, OLS key members can elect a representative or chairperson to represent their interests in official meetings related to the organisation. OLS key members in our organisation may come from different forms, there is no one model. The guidelines here may not apply as is to members of the volunteer community or employees._

OLS as an organisation is made accountable to a broader community through the involvement of the Governance Committee, referred to as Committee in this document. The board relies on the Committee to continue offering OLS services to the community. The committee will provide advisory support, feedback and recommendations for the OLS team in alignment with OLS’ missions and obligations.

Work undertaken by the Committee allows board members to more effectively deal with complex or specialised issues and manage the organisation’s direction with the recommendations by carefully presenting various interests of different shareholders. The Committee also provides opportunities to develop knowledge within the organisation to facilitate board members’ skills in areas that will most benefit the organisation. Additionally, the existence of the Committee can advocate for the interests of community members and other stakeholders to help prioritise the organisation’s goals for the benefit of the community.

The Board will facilitate the selection, election and onboarding of the Committee members. The committee should maintain representation, to the degree it’s possible, from different regions that the OLS community members represent. The Committee will revise and set a course for the selection and election process for the future members of the Committee.

### Organisation Liaison and Secretary

The Committee is supported by 1-2 Board Liaisons and 1 Organisation Secretary invited from the OLS team. The committee will be expected to define their level of involvement.  The Organisation Liaison and Secretary will not participate in the voting and consensus-building process of the Committee. The Organisation Liaison and Secretary will enable bidirectional sharing of knowledge and information between the Committee and the OLS team. Committee members may reach out to the Board directly as appropriate. In the temporary absence of the designated Liaisons, another member of the Board will serve as the Liaison or the Secretary will assume some functions with the opportunity for the Board members to asynchronously catch up on and contribute to the meeting's agenda and discussion.

Organisation Liaison and Secretary create transparency between the Committee, Board and rest of the OLS team. They also work with the Committee to represent community interests and build transparency.
The Board is  ultimately responsible for all the functions that may arise as necessary to fulfil the goals of OLS.

## Governance Meetings and Exchanges

The primary function of the Committee is to ensure that the Board operates in a manner that is conducive to achieving the mission and goals of the organisation. To enable this, the Committee will identify, discuss and carry forward the various activities with the involvement of the Board and OLS team as needed to aid/accelerate their work. The Committee and Board engage during governance meetings synchronously and via Slack or email interactions asynchronously.

In their meeting and exchanges, the Committee will follow and improve the governance process for reviewing progress and discussing issues suggested by the Board or as directly identified by the Committee. These issues will include activities that affect the organisation's operations, sustainability, future development or urgent crises to be addressed as identified by the Committee members.

### Inaugural committee in 2023

The inaugural committee in 2023 is a small group with close association to the OLS. 

In the first six months, they will get together regularly synchronously and asynchronously to review the governance process and documentation.
They will then decide on the initial areas of OLS’ work where the committee will provide their support. These will be aligned with OLS’ vision and mission, once in place and approved by both the Committee and the Board.

### Committee meeting chair: Rotating chair roles - 2024 onwards

The inaugural Committee have opted for the rotating chair roles rather than electing a committee chair to distribute leadership responsibilities. A schedule for the rotating chair will be developed by the Committee starting in 2024.

The chair will be responsible for setting the agenda for the meeting, agreeing with other Committee members who will be leading on specific agenda points, facilitating discussions during the meeting, identify actions and assign to the right individual/team, share notes with recommendations for the OLS team and ensure operational continuity by following up on the actions, which they will report at an upcoming meeting.

### Support from the OLS Core team

OLS Core Team including resident fellows and staff members may engage in a range of activities alongside the governance group such as taking forward the recommendations in the form of concrete actions. This will depend on their availability and funding to support their work. The OLS Core team will not attend committee meetings unless explicitly invited and not participate in the voting and consensus-building process of the Committee.

For the annual director’s meeting, the Committee will be requested to submit ideas and suggestions for programmes the organisation can consider undertaking in the coming year. These suggestions are then discussed and priorities are established at the organisation’s annual planning session.
