# OLS’ Governance Framework

The founders and Co-Directors of OLS referred to as the OLS Board (or simply Board), provide leadership in OLS. An Executive Director of OLS is responsible, with other directors taking leadership across different areas of OLS' work, collectively responsible for governing OLS in line with organizational priorities and commitments. They carry out their role in conjunction with a Governance Committee that provides advisory support to the Board.

The Governance Committee (Committee) should be composed of OLS community members from diverse backgrounds, identities, and experiences who can participate in an advisory capacity. There will be a minimum of five Committee Members, but the exact number may vary in each revision of the OLS Governance. The inaugural Committee in 2023 consisted of 10 members.

The Committee is supported by the OLS Team, consisting of 1-2 OLS Liaisons designated from the OLS Board and a non-director member as an Organization Secretariat, invited from the OLS team (which includes non-director staff, resident fellows, and other paid staff).

Together, these members form OLS's Governance Framework, building transparency and accountability in OLS' work and decision-making processes that affect the community, enabling a fair, equitable, and more representative space.

*Title: The governance framework of OLS encompasses a Governance Committee composed of OLS' community members and the Board of Directors (with 1-2 acting as Organisation Liaison), along with an Organization Secretariat from the OLS team. This Miro Board visually represents how these members interact with each other, ensuring that community interests are well-represented in the decision-making process and that transparency around their work is maintained. This Illustration was developed by the Committee on Miro Board in 2023: [https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMo-DiLc=/](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMo-DiLc=/)*

**Role Description**

* **OLS Governance Committee (Committee) and other key members:** A key member can refer to a member of volunteer leadership roles such as a member of the Governance Committee and other key non-employee groups that are formally established with the approval of the leadership. In OLS, we have tried to be as explicit as possible when defining roles and responsibilities. In some cases, OLS key members can elect a representative or chairperson to represent their interests in official meetings related to the organisation. OLS key members in our organisation may come from different forms, there is no one model. The guidelines here may not apply as is to members of the volunteer community or employees.
  * The committee provides an Advisory role to the Board of Directors

* **Board of Directors (Board):** The founders and Co-Directors of OLS are collectively responsible for governing and leadership of our organisation. They carry out their role in conjunction with the Governance Committee and other key members of their organisation. 
  * The Board of Directors escalate matters for transparency and accountability to the Committee.

* **Organisation Liaison and Secretary:** The Committee is supported by 1-2 Board Liaisons and 1 Organisation Secretariat invited from the OLS team. The committee will be expected to define their level of involvement.  The Organisation Liaison and Secretary will not participate in the voting and consensus-building process of the Committee. The Organisation Liaison and Secretary will enable bidirectional sharing of knowledge and information between the Committee and the OLS team. Committee members may reach out to the Board directly as appropriate. In the temporary absence of the designated Liaisons, another member of the Board will serve as the Liaison or the Secretariat will assume some functions with the opportunity for the Board members to asynchronously catch up on and contribute to the meeting's agenda and discussion.
  * Organisation Liaison and Secretary create transparency between the Committee, Board and rest of the OLS team. They also work with the Committee to represent community interests and build transparency.

**OLS Staff/Employee:** All paid members (full or part-time positions) as Directors, programme/project managers and researchers are considered OLS staff. Currently, this includes the Executive Director, Co-Directors, Programme Manager, Community Coordinator and Researchers. Resident Fellows and/or board of directors who are not paid (as employees or via contracts) are not considered staff.
  * These are paid staff of OLS.

**Resident Fellows:** OLS hosts Resident Fellows, drawing from previous graduates, mentors and/or collaborators in ongoing projects. Fellows are recruited on a rolling basis based on their areas of interest in open science that align with OLS’ vision for open science capacity building. These are paid positions and defined in collaboration with the OLS team. Based on the available funding, OLS can host a limited number of fellows at a time. This pathway is also open through collaborative grant proposals for funding from resources outside the OLS. Resident Fellows work as a part of the OLS team, participating in OLS activities and carrying out responsibilities that allow them to build their professional and leadership experience, providing a stronger foundation for future leadership roles. 
  * These are fixed-term paid fellows of OLS who may or may not join OLS core operations based on their interest and nature of funding.

**Core team:** In this document, we use “core team” to collectively refer to the OLS staff and Resident Fellows who are involved in the day-to-day activities of OLS.

**OLS-SSI Fellows:** OLS has collaborated with the Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) to host a limited number of OLS Alumni as OLS-SSI fellows in SSI Fellow networks. This allows SSI to offer fellowship to a larger pool of international fellows who qualify through the rigorous selection process of SSI fellowship. They are not part of the Core Team.

## Governance Committee Membership

The inaugural committee (2023-2024), composed of members invited by the Board from the OLS community, will create a process for electing new members from the broader community from 2024 onwards. The process will maintain the mix of experienced and early career members to allow a fair opportunity for the community to take leadership roles, participate in peer mentoring, and engage in the knowledge exchange process of the committee's work. Whenever possible, the OLS Board will identify opportunities for more community members to work alongside the Committee, such as through the creation of temporary working groups and task forces, as well as paid positions to act on recommendations from the Committee.

Detailed information about expectations and processes for onboarding and offboarding is provided in the governance documentation, which has been approved by the Committee in 2023
