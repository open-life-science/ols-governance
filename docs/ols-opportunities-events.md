# Opportunities and Events

These various roles within OLS communities allow members to participate in various capacities. Events and opportunities are designed to facilitate training, experiential learning and discussions around open science that embed contextual realities of our members as they create, share, access or collaborate on open science projects, resources and infrastructure.

To enable the collaboration of diverse community members, OLS offers the following opportunities and events:
