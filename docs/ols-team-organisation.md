# OLS Team and Organisation

## **OLS Core Team**

Board members, OLS staff and Resident Fellows together constitute the OLS Core team: https://we-are-ols.org/community.html

1. **Board of Directors**: The people collectively responsible for governing and leadership of our organisation through strategic policy direction and financial oversight. They carry out their role in conjunction with an advisory committee and other key members of their organisation. In this document, we use “core team” to refer to the Board of Directors.
2. **OLS Staff/Employee**: All paid members (full or part-time positions) as Directors, programme/project managers and researchers are considered OLS staff. Currently, this includes the Executive Director, Co-Directors, Programme Manager, Community Coordinator and Researchers, and excludes the Resident Fellows and/or board of directors who are not paid (as employees or via contracts).
3. **Resident Fellows**: OLS hosts Resident Fellows from previous graduates, mentors and/or collaborators in ongoing projects. Fellows are recruited on a rolling basis based on their areas of interest in open science that align with OLS’ vision for open science capacity building. These are paid positions and defined in collaboration with the OLS team. Based on the available funding, OLS can host a limited number of fellows at a time. This pathway is also open through collaborative grant proposals for funding from resources outside the OLS. Resident Fellows work as a part of the OLS team, participating in OLS activities and carrying out responsibilities that allow them to build their professional and leadership experience, providing a stronger foundation for future leadership roles.
4. **Contractors and interns**: Hired to manage the project-related requirements and based on budget availability.

### Organisational Reporting

Reporting obligations for the OLS are bound to the funder’s requirements. Annually,  the organisation’s performance will be explained in both internal and external project and financial reports. As part of the Committee, there is a duty of care to ensure you have a level of interest in understanding the nature of the organisation’s activities. The Committee will help ensure the integrity of the project and financial reporting.
