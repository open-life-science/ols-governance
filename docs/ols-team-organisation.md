# OLS Team and Organisation

## **OLS Core Team**

Board members, OLS staff and Resident Fellows together constitute the OLS Core team: [https://openlifesci.org/community](https://openlifesci.org/community). 

1. **Board of Directors**: The people collectively responsible for governing and leadership of our organisation through strategic policy direction and financial oversight. They carry out their role in conjunction with an advisory committee and other key members of their organisation. In this document, we use “core team” to refer to the Board of Directors.
    * Yo Yehudi, Executive Director and Business and Development Lead (0.6 FTE)
    * Bérénice Batut, Director of Learning and Technology  (0.2 FTE)
    * Malvika Sharan, Director of Partnerships and Strategy  (0.1 FTE)
    * Emmy Tsang, Director of Finance and Operation  (0.1 FTE)
2. **OLS Staff/Employee**: All paid members (full or part-time positions) as Directors, programme/project managers and researchers are considered OLS staff. Currently, this includes the Executive Director, Co-Directors, Programme Manager, Community Coordinator and Researchers, and excludes the Resident Fellows and/or board of directors who are not paid (as employees or via contracts).
    * Paz Bernaldo, Community Researcher and Programme Coordinator (1 FTE)
    * Tajuddeen Gwadabe, Programme Manager - ECB project (1 FTE)
3. **Resident Fellows**: OLS hosts Resident Fellows from previous graduates, mentors and/or collaborators in ongoing projects. Fellows are recruited on a rolling basis based on their areas of interest in open science that aligns with OLS’ vision for open science capacity building. These are paid positions and defined in collaboration with the OLS team. Based on the available funding, OLS can host a limited number of fellows at a time. This pathway is also open through collaborative grant proposals for funding from resources outside the OLS. Resident Fellows work as a part of the OLS team, participating in OLS activities and carrying out responsibilities that allow them to build their professional and leadership experience, providing a stronger foundation for future leadership roles.
