3. **Resident Fellows: **OLS hosts Resident Fellows from previous graduates, mentors and/or collaborators in ongoing projects. Fellows are recruited on a rolling basis based on their areas of interest in open science that aligns with OLS’ vision for open science capacity building. These are paid positions and defined in collaboration with the OLS team. Based on the available funding, OLS can host a limited number of fellows at a time. This pathway is also open through collaborative grant proposals for funding from resources outside the OLS. Resident Fellows work as a part of the OLS team, participating in OLS activities and carrying out responsibilities that allow them to build their professional and leadership experience, providing a stronger foundation for future leadership roles.
